# Robot Base Interface

This project is about designing an interface and php pages to control the movement of a Robot Base. And connect the interface for the robotic arm with this Interface, in addition to making the interface mobile friendly.

List of files:

1- Index.html: This html file is for the main page that allows the user to choose between controlling the Robot Base or the Robotic Arm.

2- Robot_base_interface.html: This html file creates the base controls that allow the user to move the base in any direction.

3- PHP files folder: This folder contains the PHP files that retrieve the data from database for each button the user clicks (Forward, Left, Right, Backward, and Stop).

4- robotbase.sql: This sql file is an export of the database used in this project (Import it to your database, and change database name in php files before running the project).

5- CSS folder: This folder contains the CSS files used to style both html files.

6- Interface for Robotic Arm folder: This folder contains the files of the Robotic Arm Interface project found in the link below to allow for the merging of both interfaces.
